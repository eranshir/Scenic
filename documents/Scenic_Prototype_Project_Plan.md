## 6. Success Criteria for Prototype

### Minimum Viable Prototype
- [ ] User can discover spots on a map with real sun data
- [ ] User can view detailed spot information with photos
- [ ] User can create a new spot with full metadata
- [ ] User can plan a trip with multiple spots
- [ ] Data persists between app launches

### Demo-Ready Prototype
- [ ] 50+ sample spots across multiple locations
- [ ] Smooth navigation and interactions
- [ ] Realistic sun and weather data
- [ ] Functional search and filters
- [ ] Shareable trip plans

---

## 7. Resource Requirements

### Development
- 1 iOS Developer (full-time, 6 weeks)
- UI/UX Designer (part-time for refinements)
- QA Tester (week 5-6)

### Content Creation
- Sample photography content
- Spot descriptions and tips
- Test user profiles

### Third-Party Services (Prototype Phase)
- Apple Developer Account (existing)
- WeatherKit API (free tier)
- MapKit (included with iOS)

---

## 8. Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Sun calculation accuracy**: Use proven NOAA algorithms, validate with online tools
- **Weather API limits**: Implement aggressive caching, consider fallback APIs
- **Photo storage**: Start with photo library references, defer upload to backend phase
- **Performance with large datasets**: Implement pagination early, use Core Data properly

### User Experience Risks
- **Complex creation flow**: Add progress saving, allow editing after creation
- **Information overload**: Progressive disclosure, smart defaults
- **Map usability**: Extensive testing on real devices, consider accessibility

---

## 9. Next Immediate Steps

1. **Set up Core Data models** - Foundation for all features
2. **Implement sun calculations** - Core value proposition
3. **Add photo display to spots** - Visual appeal critical for photographers
4. **Make search functional** - Basic discovery requirement
5. **Connect filters to data** - Enable targeted discovery

---

## Notes
- This plan prioritizes features that demonstrate value without requiring backend infrastructure
- Social features are minimized in favor of core photography planning features
- Each phase builds on the previous, allowing for incremental testing
- The prototype should be compelling enough to validate the concept with real photographers
