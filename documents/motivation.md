I want to plan an iOS app called Scenic for people hunting for the perfect spots in the world to take amazing photos. 

This will be a crowdsourced platform where people will be able to pick from their photos & videos and upload alongside with rich metadata. 

The rich metadata that will be extracted will be: location, direction/heading, date and time in absolute terms, time in relative to sunset / sunrise (whichever is closer), sunset/sunrise timing for that location and date, also weather on that location in that time/date. In addition the user will be able to pinpoint where he parked the car, define the hike/route he took from a known point (e.g. his car parking spot, a nearby restaurant etc.) to the point in which he took the picture. 
We will also automatically extract metadata on the photo/video itself (e.g. resolution and any presets) but also allow the user to insert professional photography metadata (e.g. camera used, lens used, presets, filters, etc.) as advanced settings. 

The user will be able to add free text and structured description (e.g. what he was trying to achieve, any considerations, any insights on how to take the photo, tips on how to get there, any logistics tips etc.). 

The app will work great for a user on their own, functioning as a a photography journal, and it will work even better as people publish their scenic spots and share. It then will function as a great tool for planning trips, will allow people to save spots of interest to use later, build itinerary of their own (adapting to their actual date and sunset/sunrise/weather conditions). 

It will be social as people will be able to comment on a certain scenic spot, or link their photos to that spot so a thread with different photos from the same spot could be consumed and discussed. 

It will have some street cred scoring mechanisms, where people will collect points/stars and ranks as they contribute more, people could upvote/give points to photos they appreciate, and people will be the 'explorer' or some other title for a certain spot they uploaded photos from. 

Now I want you to create a detailed set of documents including: a PRD, a list of screens and a detailed description for each screen, with list of functionalities and ui components  , a data model and data flows, db schema (tables etc.), project plan with phases and tasks. I want you to create an engineering document to discuss architecture choices and in particular investigate whether it will be best to use swiftui or one of the mobile frameworks.
